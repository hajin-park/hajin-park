Nature has made me capable in all manual work, it has given me the spirit of a
philosopher and ability in the sciences, taste and good manners, voluptuousness, gaiety, it has made me pious, faithful, fond of wisdom, meditative, inventive, courageous,
fond of learning and teaching, eager to equal the best, to discover new things and
make independent progress, of modest character, a student of medicine, interested
in curiosities and discoveries, cunning, crafty, sarcastic, an initiate in the mysterious
lore, industrious, diligent, ingenious, living only from day to day, impertinent, contemptuous of religion, grudging, envious, sad, treacherous, magician and sorcerer,
miserable, hateful, lascivious, obscene, lying, obsequious, fond of the prattle of old
men, changeable, irresolute, indecent, fond of women, quarrelsome, and because of
the conflicts between my nature and soul I am not understood even by those with
whom I associate most frequently.
